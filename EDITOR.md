# Level Editor — Plan & Status

Browser-based skeleton editor for the word solitaire game. Authoring tool only; the runtime is unchanged. Reachable at `#/editor` (button "✏ Editor" in the game header).

## Concept

The editor edits an abstract **skeleton**: categories are labelled `A`, `B`, `C`… instead of concrete categories. On Save, the editor picks real categories from the Unity catalog at random (constrained by `kind` and word counts) and emits a normal `LevelData` JSON the existing runtime plays unchanged.

This means: the runtime never sees a skeleton. The editor's internal state is throwaway; only the filled `LevelData` is persisted (downloaded JSON or in-memory Play preview).

## Data model (editor-internal)

```
SkeletonLevel { levelId, slotsDefault, movesLimit, categories[], board[], stock[] }
SkeletonCategory { letter, simpleCards, pinnedCategoryId? }
SkeletonBoardCard { x, y, z, letter, kind: 'category'|'simple' }
SkeletonStockEntry { letter, kind }
EditorState { level, history, brush, currentLayer, ghostBelow, ghostAbove, eraseMode, lastError }
```

**Always one category card per category.** Adding a category seeds exactly one `kind:'category'` stock entry. There is no stepper for category-card count; the card is moved between stock and board but its total stays at 1. Deleting it from the stock strip is rejected — to remove, delete the entire category.

**Allocation invariant:** for each `(letter, kind)`, `count(board) + count(stock) === N`, where `N === 1` for `kind:'category'` and `N === category.simpleCards` for `kind:'simple'`. Stock is the residual; cards never on board "fall through" to stock. The reducer enforces this on every action.

## Architecture

- `src/main.tsx` — hash router. `#/editor` → `<Editor/>`, else `<App/>`.
- `src/editor/types.ts` — Skeleton types + EditorAction union.
- `src/editor/reducer.ts` — pure reducer; invariant enforcement; `categoryCounts()` derived selector; `normalizeLevel()`; `topLayerOf()`.
- `src/editor/Editor.tsx` — top-level shell, hotkeys, save/play/load wiring, meta fields, picker mount.
- `src/editor/CategoriesRail.tsx` — left rail; one panel per category; +/- stepper; brush selector; pin button.
- `src/editor/CategoryPicker.tsx` — modal picker for pinning a letter to a real category from the combined catalog.
- `src/editor/BoardCanvas.tsx` — half-tile click grid, layer switching, ghost layers, placement, erase.
- `src/editor/fill.ts` — exposes `pools()` (icon + text + combined + byId) and `fillSkeleton()` which picks real categories (pinned first, else random from the combined pool) and assigns distinct words.
- `src/editor/skeletonIO.ts` — serialize / parse `.skel.json` files; invariant validation on load.
- `src/editor/unfill.ts` — converts a concrete `LevelData` back into a `SkeletonLevel` (letters assigned A, B, …; every category pinned to its real `categoryId`). Used by the "Load level…" dropdown.
- `src/editor/save.ts` — `saveLevelJSON` / `saveSkeletonJSON` using the File System Access API (`showSaveFilePicker` + `createWritable`) where available, blob-download fallback elsewhere. Module-scoped per-kind file handles (`level`, `skel`) so the first save prompts and subsequent saves silently overwrite the same file within the session. `clearSaveHandle('level' | 'skel')` resets a binding (called after loading a level/skeleton). Also hosts the sessionStorage preview handoff.
- `src/editor/validate.ts` — derived warnings (half-offset coverage gotcha, minZ != 0) + stats.
- `src/editor/catalog/icons.json`, `words.json` — copied from Unity (`Assets/Editor/Tools/LevelsCategoriesReplacement/categories/`).
- `src/editor/catalog/images.ts` — hand-maintained manifest of PNGs available under `public/images/`. Regen command in the file header.
- `src/editor/Editor.css` — editor-only styles.

`App.tsx` was extended: on mount it calls `consumePreviewLevel()` from sessionStorage; if present, prepends that level to the dropdown and starts there. The preview is read-once at the **module** scope (cached on first call) so React Strict Mode double-mounts don't strip it. When playing the preview, the level dropdown row reads `★ Editor preview (<levelId>)` and the header link flips to `← Back to editor` with the primary highlight — so it's obvious which level is yours and how to get back.

## Status (shipped)

- [x] **Phase 1 — Scaffold.** Hash routing, three-column shell, ✏ Editor link in game header, ← Game link back.
- [x] **Phase 2 — Skeleton state.** Types, reducer, 20 actions, invariant maintained, undo history.
- [x] **Phase 3 — Categories rail.** Panel per category with letter, pin button (📎 + pinned category name or "random"), delete. `category` row (no stepper — always 1) and `simple` row (+/- stepper). Both rows are clickable as brush selectors; active brush highlighted. Board/stock count summary per row.
- [x] **Phase 4 — Board canvas.** Half-tile click grid, vertical layer switching (▲/▼ buttons + `↑`/`↓` or `]`/`[` hotkeys), free negative-z navigation, ghost-layer toggles below/above, click-to-place from brush, click-to-erase, hover preview of 2×2 footprint, brush kind toggle (`⇄` button + `Tab`). All visual z-indexes are rebased through `Z_BASE` so negative-z cards render correctly. **Smart-stack:** placement starts at `currentLayer` and bumps `z` while that footprint is occupied at that z (Chebyshev distance ≤ 1 between anchors — half-offset overlap counts). Higher cards on z > currentLayer do NOT push the new card up; only same-z (and bumped-z) obstacles do. So you can place a z=0 card under an existing z=1 half-offset card; you can stack z=1 over four z=0 cards; you can chain-stack at the same anchor. `currentLayer` follows the final placement so the layer label tracks the just-placed card. Hover preview uses the same smart-z target so the preview lifts off existing stacks visibly.
- [x] **Phase 5 — Stock strip.** Horizontal chip list, ◂/▸/× per chip, category-card chips styled like the gold gradient.
- [x] **Phase 6 — Save & Play.** Catalog fill: pinned letters use their pinned real category; unpinned letters pick at random from the combined `text ∪ icon` pool. Word count constraint (≥ `simpleCards`) and no-duplicate-real-categories per level both enforced. Distinct words assigned per simple placement. **Save .json** = concrete `LevelData` file download. **Play** = stash filled level in sessionStorage, hash-jump to `#/`, App picks it up as level 0. Both auto-normalize layers (`normalizeLevel`) before fill, so the emitted JSON always has min z = 0.

- [x] **Phase 8 — Skeleton I/O & pinning.** **Save .skel** writes a `.skel.json` file (schema `skeleton-v1`) — the editor's intent without real categories. **Load .skel** reads a skeleton file (validates shape and the invariant) and replaces editor state. Loading pushes a history snapshot so an accidental load can be undone. Per-category 📎 button opens a searchable picker over the combined text+icon catalog, filtered to ≥ `simpleCards` available words. Pinning a letter sets `SkeletonCategory.pinnedCategoryId`; fill respects it. The `kind` field on `SkeletonCategory` is gone — the picked real category's kind is determined at fill time.
- [x] **Phase 7 — Validation panel.** Warnings: cards hidden at start by half-offset coverage; icon-category over-asking word count; info row when `minZ != 0` (reminder that Save/Play normalize automatically). Stats: board count, stock count, side-blocked count, covered count. (The "no category card" check is no longer needed — every category has exactly one by construction.)

**Topbar action group:** `← Undo (n)` · `Normalize` · `Load .skel` · `Load level…` · `Save .skel` · `Save .json` · `Play`. Undo is enabled iff history is non-empty; Normalize iff the board has cards; Save .skel iff the level is non-empty; Save .json / Play iff at least one category and one board card exist. `Load level…` lists the bundled `LEVELS` and converts the picked one back to a skeleton (every category pinned to its real id). Save .json suggests the next `level{LEVELS.length + 1}.json` filename — drop the file in `src/levels/` and add it to `src/levels/index.ts` to ship. **First save** opens the OS save dialog; the editor keeps the file handle and subsequent saves silently overwrite the same file (the button label changes to `Save .json → <filename>`). Loading a level or skeleton clears the binding. Non-Chromium browsers fall back to per-click blob downloads.

Hotkeys: `↑`/`↓` (or `]`/`[`) layer up/down, `E` erase, `M` move, `Esc` cancel pick, `Tab` simple↔category, `1..9` select category by index, `⌘Z`/`Ctrl+Z` undo. Most keys ignored when typing in inputs; Undo works from inputs too.

**Move brush.** Toggle Move mode (M or the Move button) to relocate cards without re-authoring. Click 1 picks a card on the current layer (yellow dashed outline + dimmed); Click 2 drops it at the target cell — smart-stack determines target z, excluding the picked card itself so you can drop on its own anchor's z if you want. Clicking the picked card's anchor cancels. `Esc` cancels too. Move and Erase are exclusive — switching either off clears the other; selecting a category brush clears both. `MOVE_BOARD` is history-pushing.

**Layer direction.** ▲ moves up the pyramid (z+1); ▼ moves down toward the floor (z-1). Initial layer = z=0 for an empty board, max z for a non-empty one. Negative z is allowed during authoring — place a card at z=0, drill down to z=-1 to add cards beneath. The Save and Play actions normalize automatically (shift all cards so min z = 0) before fill, so the JSON output always satisfies the game's bottom-floor rule. There is also a Normalize button in the topbar for explicit shifts during authoring.

**Undo.** Structural edits push a `{ level, currentLayer }` snapshot onto `history`. The Undo button (and `⌘Z`) pops one and restores both fields atomically. Meta-field changes (level id, slots, moves) and UI state (brush, layer, ghosts, erase, move, pickedCard) are excluded — undo doesn't churn through every keystroke or every brush tap. History-pushing actions: `ADD_CATEGORY`, `REMOVE_CATEGORY`, `SET_PINNED_CATEGORY`, `INC_SIMPLE`, `DEC_SIMPLE`, `PLACE_BOARD`, `REMOVE_BOARD`, `MOVE_BOARD`, `REORDER_STOCK`, `DELETE_STOCK`, `NORMALIZE_LAYERS`, `LOAD_SKELETON`. Snapshots are pushed only when the action actually mutated the level (failed actions don't push).

## Missing features (not in this milestone)

Priority guess in parentheses.

- **Drag-to-reorder stock** (low). Up/down arrows already work; drag is convenience.
- **localStorage autosave + restore** (low). The editor state already persists to **sessionStorage** (`editor.state.v1`) on every change and hydrates on mount, so the editor → game → editor round-trip and in-tab reloads survive. localStorage would extend that across tab close — a small follow-on.
- **BFS solvability check** (low). Validation flags obviously unwinnable layouts but doesn't prove a level is solvable. A "Run solver" button could try.
- **Re-roll button** (low). Same skeleton, re-run fill with a different RNG seed to pick different real categories.
- **Skeleton export/import** (low). Save/load the skeleton itself (separate from the concrete `LevelData`) for later re-rolls.
- **Image-category coverage hint** (low). When `kind=icon` and a designer cranks `simpleCards` very high, surface a hint of "max words available in any image category" so they understand the constraint.
- **Visual style for simple cards** (cosmetic). Currently a plain white card with a small lowercase letter — distinguishable from category cards but bland. Could tint by letter index for at-a-glance grouping.
- **Same-`(x,y)` stacking authoring** (subtle). Today, clicking `(x,y)` on layer `z` where the same `(x,y)` is occupied at `z` is rejected. Stacking at the same `(x,y)` across different `z` works (`(0,0,z=0)` then switch layer to `z=1`, click `(0,0)` — places `(0,0,z=1)`). This is correct but worth documenting; users may try clicking on a card and expect a stack to grow on the same layer.

## Catalog refresh

The image manifest is hand-maintained. To add new image categories:

1. Copy PNGs into `web/public/images/` using the convention `<category_lower>__<word_snake>.png`.
2. Regen `src/editor/catalog/images.ts` from the shell command in its file header.
3. If a new Unity category is needed, the JSON catalogs in `src/editor/catalog/{icons,words}.json` are direct copies of the Unity counterparts — re-copy from `Assets/Editor/Tools/LevelsCategoriesReplacement/categories/`.

## Routing & deploy

Hash-based routing keeps both the game and the editor in the same Vite bundle, the same `index.html`, and the same GitHub Pages deployment. The editor is desktop-only by design — same as the game.
